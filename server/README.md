# TypeScript ServerThis is an Express server written in TypeScript with ESLint 9 and Airbnb style guide.## Scripts- `npm run dev` - Start the development server with hot reload- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript- `npm start` - Run the compiled JavaScript- `npm run generate` - Generate private keys and Ethereum addresses- `npm run lint` - Check code for linting errors- `npm run lint:fix` - Auto-fix linting errors## DevelopmentThe TypeScript source files are in the `src/` directory.The compiled JavaScript files are output to the `dist/` directory.## Generating Private Keys and AddressesTo generate private keys and their corresponding public keys (Ethereum addresses), run:```bashnpm run generate```This script uses the `@noble/secp256k1` and `ethereum-cryptography` libraries to:1. Generate random private keys using `@noble/secp256k1`'s `utils.randomSecretKey()`2. Derive the uncompressed public key from each private key using `getPublicKey(privateKey, false)`3. Create Ethereum-style addresses (0x + 20 bytes) by:   - Removing the first byte (0x04 prefix) from the uncompressed public key   - Taking the Keccak-256 hash of the remaining public key bytes   - Using the last 20 bytes of the hash as the addressThe script will output 3 sets of credentials that you can use for testing:- **Private Key**: Used for signing transactions (keep secure!)- **Public Key**: The full uncompressed public key- **Address**: The Ethereum-style address (0x...)### Example Output```🔐 Generating key pairs...Account 1:Private Key: a1b2c3d4...Public Key:  04e5f6g7...Address:     0x1234567890abcdef...Account 2:...```### Usage1. Use the **addresses** in your server's balance object2. Use the **private keys** on the client side for signing transactions3. **Never** commit private keys to version control!## LintingThis project uses ESLint 9 with TypeScript support and follows Airbnb style guide conventions including:- Single quotes- 2-space indentation- Semicolons required- Trailing commas in multi-line objects/arrays- Max line length of 100 characters
