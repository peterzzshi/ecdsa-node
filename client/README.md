# TypeScript React ClientThis is a React client written in TypeScript with Vite, ESLint 9, and Airbnb style guide.## Scripts- `npm run dev` - Start the development server with hot reload- `npm run build` - Build the TypeScript project for production- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build- `npm run lint` - Check code for linting errors- `npm run lint:fix` - Auto-fix linting errors## DevelopmentAll TypeScript source files are in the `src/` directory with `.tsx` and `.ts` extensions.## LintingThis project uses ESLint 9 with TypeScript support and follows Airbnb style guide conventions for React:- Single quotes- 2-space indentation- Semicolons required- Trailing commas in multi-line objects/arrays- Max line length of 100 characters- React Hooks rules enforced- TypeScript strict mode enabled## Type SafetyAll components are fully typed with TypeScript:- React component props are typed with interfaces- Axios responses have type annotations- No `any` types (proper error handling with AxiosError)
